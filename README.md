# Black
 Javascript simplifier and replacer programming language; code in Black for HTML and web development use; meant to simplify the complexity of javascript into a language that is easy to use in creating websites and development environments.

# Updates
Black currently has a couple of updates regarding the syntax, and has a lexer, parser, and interpreter, but does not have an IDE. 
We are thinking of using an online IDE that can connect to the internet and transfer code to and from.
